    <h2 class="sectiontitle">The Problem</h2>
    <p class="paragraph"><span>- The</span> Great Recession is the most contemporary example of significant economic upset on a global scale.
      <br>- The effect of the recession can be seen and studied in numerous contexts.
      <br>- <strong>Not</strong> a lot of study is done in terms of global shipping and trade.
      <br>
      <br><strong>We want to learn, "the effect of the great recession on global shipping routes"<br><br></strong>- Especially when it comes to third world countries, and countries which may offer lower potential for trade profitability, it is possible that fluctuations in the GDPs of major nations, especially the US, significantly change trade routes
      <br>- Or, perhaps, trade routes offer stability to global markets in that they do not change based on global GDPs
      <br>
      <br>- Because there is not a lot of research in this context, we need to provide the ability to filter and refine data, so as to identify correlations and causations between changes in GDP and the impact on global trade.
      <br>
      <br><strong><em>Tasks We Need to Support:</em></strong>
      <br>1. Did shipping firms chose to reduce or expand trading capacity going into and out of the recession?
      <br>2 .Did any particular markets become excluded from trade due to these reductions/expansions?
      <br>3. In what ways does the overall global trade network change as a result of market forces relating to depression and GDP of individual countries?
      <br>4. Looking into ship efficiency and age, were specific ships utilized changed out in response to efficiency concerns, i.e. were efficient vessels moved from low profit routes to high profit routes? How did the makeup of the active fleet change?
      <br>5. How were different nations impacted by the dynamics of global trade? Were developed and underdeveloped nations impacted similarly or differently?</p>

      <br>- They plan to write a paper on this topic and need a tool help them define their focus and angle of attack.

    <h2 class="sectiontitle">The Data</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">- The data for this project consists of maritime ship movements for dates in 2006, 2009, and 2012.
      <br>- It is tabular and stored as an Excel sheet.
      <br>- It contains 511,119 ship movements and characteristics for 3515 ships and 9411 ports.
      <br>- Characteristics include Move ID, Place ID, Vessel ID, Movement Date, etc.</p><img class="image" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 599px" src="images/Screen-Shot-2017-05-01-at-7.56.27-AM.png" srcset="images/Screen-Shot-2017-05-01-at-7.56.27-AM-p-500.png 500w, images/Screen-Shot-2017-05-01-at-7.56.27-AM-p-800.png 800w, images/Screen-Shot-2017-05-01-at-7.56.27-AM-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Screen-Shot-2017-05-01-at-7.56.27-AM.png 1218w" width="599">

    <p class="paragraph">Because the entire nature of the Maritime Network is easier to understand in the context of a world map, this is what our target users requested. This means that we had to use marks - lines for routes, circles for ports, port connections, etc. which could not be used to encode much of the data, or the map would be too cluttered.
      <br>
      <br>However, we need to provide the data which each route represents, for analysis. Solution? Use the map section to select routes, based on pre-selected filters. Then use a separate section of the visualization to <em>analyze</em> the data corresponding to the selected routes.
      <br>
      <br><strong>So, the main task of the map is then selection. Features we included to support this include:</strong>
      <br>1. Route Opacity = Relative Route Frequency
      <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More highly traversed routes are darker, changes in more traversed routes will likely have a greater effect on the overall network, so it is important that the user be able to identify those routes which are most travelled.
      <br>
      <br>2. Routes Highlighted in Yellow &amp; Brought to Front on Mouseover
      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the magnitude of the data, it is possible for the viz to get very cluttered, making the routes hard to distinguish. We solved this problem by having each route turn yellow and move to the front of the svg when the user scrolls over it.
      <br>
      <br>3. Selected Routes Highlighted in Green
      <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because the map section interacts with the line-chart at the bottom of the page, selected routes which have been added to the line-chart need to remain highlighted so they can be de-selected if necessary.</p>

    <h4><em>Line Graph Description</em></h4>
    <p class="paragraph">The line graph shows the frequency of travel along four routes across three years.
      <br>Position encodes both year and frequency, a very highly ranked channel for quantitative data.
      <br>Text indicates which lines represent which routes.</p><img class="image-3" sizes="50vw" src="images/Screen-Shot-2017-05-01-at-10.23.16-AM.png" srcset="images/Screen-Shot-2017-05-01-at-10.23.16-AM.png 500w, images/Screen-Shot-2017-05-01-at-10.23.16-AM.png 800w, images/Screen-Shot-2017-05-01-at-10.23.16-AM.png 1080w, images/Screen-Shot-2017-05-01-at-10.23.16-AM.png 1600w, images/Screen-Shot-2017-05-01-at-10.23.16-AM.png 2000w, images/Screen-Shot-2017-05-01-at-10.23.16-AM.png 2600w, images/Screen-Shot-2017-05-01-at-10.23.16-AM.png 2774w">
    <p class="paragraph">This graph allows the user to compare routes more specifically because the frequencies are visible as numbers.
      <br>They can also see all three years at once as opposed to stepping through time.
      <br>The link between the two graphs is an important part of the visualization. The final webpage has the map, then the filters, then the line chart, from top to bottom. In this way, it is clear that the filters apply to both the map and chart.
      <br>Highlighting a line on the map will cause it to appear on the lower line chart.
      <br><em>The X-axis and Y-axis automatically rescale each time a new line is added</em>
    </p>
    <h4><em>Filter Description</em></h4>
    <p class="paragraph">The filters determine what frequency data should be aggregated before selecting the "Generate Map" button
      <br>These filters were specifically requested by the target users, and are hard-coded into the JavaScript as opposed to being requests to some database.</p>

In this example, it has completed it's task.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">2. In this case, it seems as if the average shipping into and out of South Africa is not greatly affected by the recession. However, in 2006, the route from Singapore to Durban was by far the most traversed, over 2x as much as the next closest route. This routes traversals dropped almost 66%, while the traversals from Singapore to Richards Bay increased almost constantly. This might lead a target used to investigate if shipping companies decided to start shipping from Singapore to Richards Bay in South Africa, instead of Durban.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">2. It seems that shipping within the US is more or less stable. This might be an interesting point, because the GDP of the whole country fluxuates, shipping never changes, perhaps only the quantity of goods does.</p>

    <h1 class="reflectionheading">If We Could Do It Again....</h1>
    <p class="paragraph"><strong>Additional Features:<br></strong>- Scrolling Zoom : A scrolling zoom would allow the users to select routes more easily, while still keeping the page the same size
      <br>- Region Grouping: It is difficult to get an actual grasp of shipping data to a <em>region</em>, without selecting all the possible routes going to all the possible ports in that region. It would be great to have the ability to aggregate the data for, say, "all routes into and out of a country" or "all routes into and out of a region." This would mean an easier ability to inspect larger trends such as "change in shipping to and from the USA vs Eastern Asia from 2006 to 2012"&nbsp;
      <br>- Auto Filter-Setup: The goal of this visualization is to support a grant proposal to purchase additional data. It would be great if, once this data is found, the new csvs (with new attributes, and therefore new potential filters) could simply be loaded into the same tool for analysis. However, for the sake of time and practicality, we hard coded each of the filters.
      <br>
      <br><strong>Alternative Design: Force Directed Graph<br></strong>It would have been interesting to try and represent the network as a force directed graph which changes given the time. Trends like "There is less shipping between China and the USA from 2006 to 2009" could be easy to identify by seeing that the USA and China nodes move further apart from 2006 to 2009. However, we had to use a map for the sake of intuitive use and understanding.</p>
